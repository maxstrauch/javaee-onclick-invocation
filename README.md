JavaEE Onclick Invocation
==

Simple demo to demonstrate how to "listen" on `onclick` or `onchange` events of HTML form checkbox elements and invoke a method in a backing bean once the "state" of the checkbox elements changes. 

This demo uses the GlassFish 4 JavaEE server and can be opened as a NetBeans 7 project.
